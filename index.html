    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>When it comes to maximizing revenue in the workplace,
      very often scholars and executives talks about strategy,
      structure, and processes. There is less or no focus on how
      to reduce stress and workload for employees as a way to
      increase productivity and maximizing revenue.
      For example, in the service industries, there’s always requiring
      overtime, high expectation and pushing a sales cultures
      to maximize revenue especially in busy seasons.
      While all these processes and strategies can help companies
      generate more revenue, it is also important to recognize the
      negative impact employees have to endures as well as the
      potential lost revenue that a company will insure due to stress.
      <strong>The American Institutes of Stress (2007)</strong> reported that the US
      Industries lost <strong><em>300 billion dollars</em></strong> a year due to stress.
      Most of the common effects of stress are: accidents, absenteeism,
      employee turnover and lack productivity, as well as direct medical,
      legal and insurance costs to business owners.I believe with more
      professional development in the areas of effective leadership and
      communication, US Industries can decrease the amount of money that
      are being forfeited due to stress and at the same time maximize
      revenues in the long-term. </p>
      <h2>Why Communication and Leadership Training?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>US Industries lost 300 billion dollars a year due to stress</li>
          <li>The Ken Blanchard Company (2009) did a study titled
            “The High Cost of Doing Nothing: Quantifying the Impact of
            Leadership on the Bottom Line” in which they found that
            the average company is forfeiting $1 million per year in
            untapped potentials. </li>
          <li>Tor Dahl, former president of the World Confederation of
            Productivity Science and a member of the Board of Directors
            for the American Productivity and Quality Center, reported
            that “...each individual in an organization can still increase
            productivity by at least 30%” if the company and organization
            have a more optimal leadership.</li>
          <li>Furthermore, a calculation done by Development Dimension
            International (DDI), which is a corporate organization that
            help businesses develop leaders, found out that one
            incompetent leader can cost a company $126,000 a year. </li>
          <li>Additionally, Smart CEO reported that: Less-than-optimal
            leadership practices cost the typical organization an
            amount equal to as much as 7% of their total annual sales.
            At least 9% and possibly as much as 32% of an organization’s
            voluntary turnover can be avoided through better leadership
            skills. Better leadership can generate a 3 - 4% improvement
            in customer satisfaction scores and a corresponding 1.5%
            increase in revenue growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Solution is...</h3>
          <p>I believe with more professional development in the areas
            of effective leadership and communication, US Industries
            can decrease the amount of money that are being forfeited
            due to stress and at the same time maximize revenues in
            the long-term. </p>
